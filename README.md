# Introduction
The Rudal Waypoint-to-Target Guidance System is designed to enhance the effectiveness of missiles in achieving their intended objectives. By incorporating waypoint navigation, the system allows missiles to follow a predefined path before homing in on the target, increasing accuracy and reducing collateral damage.

This repository comprehensively overviews the guidance system's features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

# Features
- Waypoint Navigation: Define a series of waypoints for the missile to traverse before reaching the target, improving precision and evading countermeasures.
- Advanced Targeting: Utilize sophisticated targeting algorithms to optimize the missile's path and increase the likelihood of successful hits.
- Real-time Tracking: Incorporate real-time tracking data to adjust the missile's trajectory and ensure accurate course correction.
- User-friendly Interface: Intuitive interface for setting waypoints, configuring target parameters, and monitoring the missile's progress.
- Customization Options: Modify system parameters and algorithms to tailor the guidance system for specific mission requirements.
